# Spotify_Artist_Recommendation

Our goal is to provide a recommendation system using content based filtering algorithm that recommends its users similar artist based on any particular genre,sub-genre, followers, popularity. I have chosen to build Content-based recommendation system to predict more accurate results by text based recommendation. Content-based recommendation mainly depends on item features for recommendations. In short, we will use Python to develop this model and use Tableau to help Spotifyunderstand its userâ€™s choice and aid them to enhance their business & customer satisfaction.
